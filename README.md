# Hi, I'm Andrew Von Stieglitz! 👋

## About Me 🙌

I am a 22 year old male (he/him) from Sydney! I develop and design video games, phone apps and websites. I am currently completing my double bachelor's degree in business and computer science. When I am not programming, I love getting the green screen out and uploading videos to youtube.

## My Life In Software 👨‍💻

Ever since I was shown Visual Basic in 2010 I was immediatly intregered with the capabilites of code. I wrote small programs like changing the color of buttons! 🙌

I wanted to make video games so I downloaded Gamemaker 8.1 in 2011 and learnt a lot about programming from drag and drop. I used and still use GM extensivily for prototyping ideas and participating in game jams. 🎮

Over my time in highschool I learnt Java and C#. Java because I created mods for Minecraft. C# because I wanted to learn the Unity framework and continue my young career into game development. 📜

At University I have been required to teach Web Development and Game Development and found that understood the concepts much better while im teaching them! 👨🏻‍🏫
