# Hi, I'm Andrew Von Stieglitz! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me ðŸ™Œ

I am a 22 year old male (he/him) from Sydney! I develop and design video games, phone apps and websites. I am currently completing my double bachelor's degree in business and computer science. When I am not programming, I love getting the green screen out and uploading videos to youtube.
